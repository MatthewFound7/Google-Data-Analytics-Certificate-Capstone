# Google Data Analytics Certificate - Capstone Project

As part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, I completed a Capstone project. The project aim was to show off my newly aquired data analytics and data story-telling skills, by evaluating a dataset produced by the company, Bellabeat, with a focus on extracted trends useful for understanding the usage of their fitness tracking devices. 

I decided to use R for the data processing side of the project, and ran this through a markdown page to produce a report of my findings and methodology.

The project has not been maintained since completing in 2024, and so has plenty of technical debt.

You can read the code and report evaluation in `Capstone.md`, which contains methodology, data processing (R), data visualisation (R), and trend evaluation.
